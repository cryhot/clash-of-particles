 * @brief Simple definition of a binary heap containing pointers to values.
 *
 * @author Jean-RaphaÃ«l GAGLIONE
 *
 * This heap does not handle NULL values.
 *
 * Inserting a value and extracting the minimum value are guaranteed
 * to have a worst-case complexity in $O(\log n)$ where $n$ is the
 * size of the heap.
 *
 * The API of the binary heap is defined as follows:
 *
 * - a function to create an empty heap
 * - a function to check if the heap is empty
 * - a function to insert a new value in the heap
 * - a function to get the minimum value in the heap
 * - a function to deallocate the binary heap
